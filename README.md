This was an project to improve Super Zombie Fortress from it's current state, I personally have been lacking development for quite some time and it was remain private until it was a working state. This is a now archived project and I recommend seeing [Red Sun Over Paradise](https://github.com/redsunservers/SuperZombieFortress) for their variation.
